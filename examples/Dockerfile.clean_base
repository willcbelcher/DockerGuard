# Example Dockerfile with a clean base image
# This base image (nginx-unprivileged) runs as a non-root user and we use a specific tag
FROM nginxinc/nginx-unprivileged:stable-alpine

# Add metadata
LABEL purpose="demonstrate-clean-base-image"

# Safe instruction
ENV APP_ENV=production

# Explicitly set user (inherited from base, but good practice to be explicit)
USER 101
